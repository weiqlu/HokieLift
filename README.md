# HokieLift

HokieLift is a rideshare/carpool app for Virginia Tech students.

## What it does

- Students can **post rides** they’re offering to/from Virginia Tech
- Students can **find rides** and **request/join** available trips

## Why

Right now, most carpool coordination happens in scattered Reddit/Facebook posts. HokieLift is meant to make it easier to find and organize rides in one place.

## Status

Early development / planning in progress.
